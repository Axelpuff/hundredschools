Laozi, literally "old master", refers to a text also known as the *Daodejing* (literally "the classic of dao and de") and also to a likely mythological figure. The *Laozi* features a cosmology centered around the Way (*dao*), which is portrayed as the formless and unknowable unity out of which determinate things emerge and return. The *Laozi* suggests that suppleness, weakness, and stillness surpass the application of force and energetic behavior, and it applies this notion to war and political theory.
