Laozi, literally "old master", refers to a text also known as the Daodejing (literally "the classic of dao and de") and also to a likely mythological figure. The Laozi features a cosmology centered around the Dao (Way), which is portrayed as the formless and unknowable unity out of which determinate things emerge and return. The Laozi suggests that suppleness, weakness, and stillness beat the application of force and energetic behavior, and it applies this notion to war and political theory.
