In order to justify the existence of ghosts, in addition to the *Odes*, Mozi also appeals to stories about the Xia, Shang, and Zhou. Some, such as the "Instructions of Yi" and "Declaration of Yu", closely resemble passages in the *History*. Mozi also uses stories of rulers who were buried in nondescript ways to advocate for modest burials, which later became a hallmark of Mohism.
