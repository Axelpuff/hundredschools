The *History* is another text that Confucius quotes directly in the *Analects*. His notions of virtue appears to come from an interpretation of the *History*. In the above passage, for example, he uses a passage about how one's filial piety can exert an influence on the government to justify his own lack of an official position. This conception that the influence of internally cultivated virtue outweighs external positions would become a key tenent of Confucianism, and it would be either iterated or refuted by nearly all later thinkers.
