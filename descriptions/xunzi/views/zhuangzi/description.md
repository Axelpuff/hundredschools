Xunzi writes that Zhuangzi tried to take Heaven's perspective, while in reality it is unwise and irresponsible to neglect the human perspective. Humans have a specific role within the cosmos, which they play well by living by ritual and the standards of righteousness.

However, Xunzi takes insight from Zhuangzi when he claims that "names have no predetermined appropriateness"(*Xunzi*, Chapter Twenty-Two). However, Xunzi takes this to mean that names are decided by custom to be useful, not as revealing the relativity of good and bad.
