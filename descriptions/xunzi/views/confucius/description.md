Xunzi sees Confucius as the greatest sage in history. Unlike the later thinkers, Confucius did not fall into the trap of getting fixated on "one corner of the way." See *Analects* 9.2: "A villager from Daxiang remarked sarcastically: 'How great is Kongzi! He is so broadly learned, and yet has failed to make a name for himself in any particular endeavor.'"
