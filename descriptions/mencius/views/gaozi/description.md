Gaozi is mostly known through the mentions of him in the *Mencius*. A chapter in the *Mencius* is named after Gaozi, in which Gaozi's questions allow Mencius to lay out his own view of human nature. Mencius uses Gaozi in other places for the sake of illustration, such as his mention that Gaozi also has an "unperturbed heart" (is not easily shaken by external circumstances), a backhanded compliment considering that Mencius uses it to emphasize how easy attaining such a heart is.
