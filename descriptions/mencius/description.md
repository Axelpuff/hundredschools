Mengzi, or Mencius (Jesuit Latin name), was a traveling thinker who based his philosophy on Confucius. However, he elaborated it in much more detail, describing human nature ("xing") as similar to sprouts: basically good, but capable of going bad with neglect. Mencius' life and sayings were written down as dialogs in a text bearing his name, which is more cohesive than the Analects. Mencius' version of Confucianism ultimately became standard after the unification of China.
