The Inward Training ("Neiye") is a text of unknown authorship, which lays out a cosmology of the Dao (or Way) and outlines a mystical practice for attaining inner power and calmness. Some believe it provided the basic spiritual practice that later texts, such as the Laozi, built upon, while others see it as a practical application of the Laozi. Regardless, it presents the emerging idea of the Dao as an underlying cosmic force, with which one can acknowledge and/or align oneself to their benefit.
