Gongsun Longzi was a philosopher from the "School of Names". Similar to Huizi, he is known for his philosophy of language. His most famous claim, "A white horse is not a horse," plays with the precise meaning of the word 非 (is not) and was later picked up by Zhuangzi. See *Zhuangzi* Chapter 2: "Using a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a nonhorse to show that a horse is not a horse."
