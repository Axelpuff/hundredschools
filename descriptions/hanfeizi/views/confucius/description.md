Han Feizi thought of Confucius as a the most benevolent and righteous person to have lived. But to him, Confucius was merely a demonstration of how ineffective these traits are: despite his greatness, he only had seventy followers. Advising rulers to rule on the basis of being benevolent and righteous like Confucius would give them seventy loyal subjects, assuming they could reach the level of self-cultivation that Confucius did. On the other hand, even a mediocre ruler can create order by using their positional power.
