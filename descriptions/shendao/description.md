Shen Dao, usually referred to by other thinkers as Shenzi, was a figure who focused on political theory and whose work only survives in the form of the "Shenzi fragments". Shen Dao claimed that when the law is as automatic and impartial as nature itself, the people will not build resentment towards the ruler or each other. He emphasized the importance of ruling by law and positional power, rather than relying on personal virtue. Xunzi critiqued his ideas, while Han Feizi praised them and built on them further.
