Laozi appears as a character in the inner chapters of the Zhuangzi multiple times, usually critiquing Confucius. One major scene is Laozi's funeral, which is one of the first times Zhuangzi's attitude towards death is expressed (death is just another transformation). It is likely that Zhuangzi sees himself as following in the footsteps of Laozi. However, Zhangzi seems to have a higher value of learning and intellectual activities than Laozi, considering the breadth of the *Zhuangzi* and the many thinkers it references.
