Multiple dialogs in the Zhuangzi are dialogs between Huizi and Zhuangzi, and it is possible that they actually were friends in the same court. Huizi often plays the rational, logical foil to Zhuangzi's absurdity. Outside of these scenes, Zhuangzi treats him as a brilliant but futile thinker, a figure he respects deeply but also thinks is trapped in distinctions. The School of Names' paradoxes likely informed Zhuangzi's stance on the limitations of words and names.
