Zhuangzi was the first major figure to present a truly grand synthesis of classical Chinese philosophy. Positioned at the middle of the Warring States period, he drew from Confucius, Mozi, Laozi, and Mencius, and he likely crossed paths with Huizi and the collector of the *Neiye*.

Like the later syntheses, Zhuangzi drew a conclusion from all the previous thinkers. But paradoxically, his thesis was that firm, constant, unequivocal knowledge is impossible. He expresses this thesis in a playful work (the eponymous *Zhuangzi*) composed of dialogs, ruminations, and fables. Zhuangzi advises letting go of hard distinctions and labels, which bring people into conflict and expend fruitless effort. Distinctions between "this" and "that", "good" and "bad", are all relative. The sage sees through these distinctions and is ambivalent to official titles, fame, and even death itself. Someone who has the Way (*dao*) is characterized by this ambivalence and by an effortless, spiritual grace in their actions.

The *Zhuangzi* is stunningly inclusive and diverse in its subjects: amputees feature in the work as sages, a female character explains how she teaches the Way, a ruler learns the Way from his butcher, and some of the dialogs are between animals. The work is full of both respect and witty critiques for all the thinkers it draws on. It presents an approach to philosophy and to life which remains just as valid today.
