Shen Buhai was prime minister in the state of Han during the fourth century BCE. He is credited for developing the system of "administrative methods" (*shu*), a system for evaluating the performance of ministers and rewarding or punishing them accordingly. His methods influenced Han Feizi, who saw Shen Buhai as the counterpart to Lord Shang.
